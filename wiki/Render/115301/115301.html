<div class="wikidoc"><h2>Microsoft SQL Server 2008 CTP and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Databases and Samples Overview</h2>
<b>Updated: February 2008</b><br /><br />The Microsoft SQL Server sample databases and sample code available on CodePlex.com are designed to work with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and Microsoft SQL Server 2005.<br />
<h3>AdventureWorks Database</h3>The installers for the AdventureWorks OLTP sample database are located on the Releases tab in the Adventure Works Sample Databases Product project.<br /><br />The AdventureWorksDB.msi contains the <b>AdventureWorks</b> OLTP database files. Completely remove previous installations of the database before running the MSI to extract the database files. To remove a previous download of an AdventureWorks database:
<ol><li>Drop the <b>AdventureWorks</b> or <b>AdventureWorksDW</b> database.</li>
<li>From <b>Add or Remove Programs</b>, select <b>AdventureWorksDB</b> or <b>AdventureWorksBI</b> and click <b>Remove</b>.</li></ol>
<br />To remove an AdventureWorks database installed by using setup
<ol><li>Drop the <b>AdventureWorks</b> or <b>AdventureWorksDW</b> database.</li>
<li>From Add or Remove Programs, select <b>Microsoft SQL Server 2005</b> and click <b>Change</b>.</li>
<li>From Component Selection, select <b>Workstation Components</b> and then click <b>Next</b>.</li>
<li>From Welcome to the SQL Server Installation Wizard, click <b>Next</b>.</li>
<li>From System Configuration Check, click <b>Next</b>.</li>
<li>From Change or Remove Instance, click <b>Change Installed Components</b>.</li>
<li>From Feature Selection, expand the <b>Documentation, Samples, and Sample Databases node.</b></li>
<li>Select <b>Sample Code and Applications</b>.</li>
<li>Expand <b>Sample Databases</b>, select the sample database to be removed and select <b>Entire feature will be unavailable</b>. Click <b>Next</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Install</b> and finish the installation wizard.</li></ol>
If you are using more than one instance of Microsoft SQL Server on the machine where you want to install the database you may need to change the directory where the contents of this MSI is installed in the installation wizard to match the directory where the master database file is located. To determine where the <b>master</b> database file is located, from either SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Management Studio Express, connect to the instance where you want to install the <b>AdventureWorks</b> database. Execute the following query:<br /><br /> <span class="codeInline"> select physical_name from sys.database_files where name = &#39;master&#39; </span> <br /><br />The installers for SQL Server 2008 sample databases attach them during installation.  For SQL Server 2005 to use this sample database and the following samples, you must attach the files to an instance of either Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition or Microsoft SQL Server. In either SQLCMD or SQL Server Management Studio, execute a script similar to the following:<br /><br /> <span class="codeInline"> exec sp_attach_db @dbname = N&#39;AdventureWorks&#39;, </span><br /> <span class="codeInline">    @filename1 = N&#39;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data\AdventureWorks_Data.mdf&#39;, </span><br /> <span class="codeInline">    @filename2 = N&#39;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data\AdventureWorks_log.ldf&#39; </span> <br /><br />If you have installed these files to a different drive or directory, you must revise the paths appropriately before you execute the <b>sp_attach_db</b> stored procedure.<br /><br /><b>Note</b>: For Microsoft Windows 2003 and Microsoft Windows XP operating systems you must have a default instance of the server installed in order to successfully install sample databases to a named instance for SQL Server 2008.  <br /><br /><b>Note</b>: If you are having trouble with the SQL Server 2008 database installers when attaching to the default server <b>(local)</b> then change the server in the connection dialog to specify the name of your local machine instead.<br />
<h3>AdventureWorks Data Warehouse Database and Analysis Services Project</h3>The installers for the AdventureWorks BI sample database and AS projects are located on the Releases tab in the Adventure Works Sample Databases Product project.<br />The AdventureWorksBI.msi contains the <b>AdventureWorksDW</b> data warehouse database files and the Analysis Services projects for the Standard and Enterprise editions. <b>AdventureWorksDW</b> and the Analysis Services projects are not supported in SQL Server Express. Remove previous installations of the <b>AdventureWorksDW</b> database and Analysis Services projects before running this MSI. See the above instructions on how to remove previous installations of the database. Also see the above instructions about how to install these files if you have multiple instances on your server. The installers for SQL Server 2008 sample databases attach them during installation. For SQL Server 2005 to use this sample database and the following samples, you must attach the files to an instance of either Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition or Microsoft SQL Server. In either SQLCMD or SQL Server Management Studio, execute a script similar to the following:<br /><br /> <span class="codeInline">exec sp_attach_db @dbname=N&#39;AdventureWorksDW&#39;, </span><br /> <span class="codeInline">    @filename1=N&#39;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data\AdventureWorksDW_Data.mdf&#39;, </span><br /><span class="codeInline">   @filename2=N&#39;C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\Data\AdventureWorksDW_log.ldf&#39;</span> <br /><br />If you have installed these files to a different drive or directory, you will have to revise the paths appropriately before you execute the <b>sp_attach_db</b> stored procedure.  Note that you must detach the database in order to uninstall it.  By default the Analysis Services projects are installed to <i>drive</i><b>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Tools\Samples\AdventureWorks Analysis Services Project</b> for SQL Server 2008 and <i>drive</i><b>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Tools\Samples\AdventureWorks Analysis Services Project</b> for SQL Server 2005. To deploy the project, perform the following steps:
<ol><li>From the <b>SQL Server Business Intelligence Development Studio</b> tool bar, click <b>File</b>, point to <b>Open</b> and then click <b>Project/Solution</b>.</li>
<li>Browse to <i>drive</i><b>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Tools\Samples\AdventureWorks Analysis Services Project</b> for SQL Server 2008 and<i>drive</i><b>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Tools\Samples\AdventureWorks Analysis Services Project</b> for SQL Server 2005, select the file <b>Adventure Works.sln</b> in either the Enterprise or Standard folder and click <b>Open</b>.  Use the solution in the Standard folder if you are using the Standard edition of SQL Server, otherwise use the solution in the Enterprise folder for other supported editions.</li>
<li>From <b>Solution Explorer</b>, right-click <b>Adventure Works DW</b> and select <b>Deploy</b> or <b>Process</b>.</li></ol>
<br /><b>Note</b>: If you are having trouble with the SQL Server 2008 database installers when attaching to the default server <b>(local)</b> then change the server in the connection dialog to specify the name of your local machine instead.<br />
<h3>SQL Server Samples</h3>Installers for the complete set of SQL Server code samples are located on the Releases tab of this project.  You can also click on the Releases tab of other product sample projects for installers for that particular technology area of SQL Server.<br />The SqlServerSamples.msi contains samples for Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition. Most of the samples have been developed in both Microsoft Visual C# and Microsoft Visual Basic .NET. Samples that do not work on SQL Server Express are noted in the description of the sample. Run the MSI to extract the<br />samples. Unless you specify otherwise, the samples are installed in <i>drive</i><b>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Samples</b> for SQL Server 2008 and <i>drive</i><b>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Samples</b> for SQL Server 2005. To execute the Transact-SQL scripts on SQL Server Express, use the following parameters with <b>SQLCmd</b>:<br /><br /> <b><span class="codeInline">SQLCmd -S</span></b>  <i><span class="codeInline">servername</span></i><b><span class="codeInline">\</span></b><i><span class="codeInline">instancename</span></i> <b><span class="codeInline">-E -I -i</span></b> <i><span class="codeInline">filename</span></i><b><span class="codeInline">.sql</span></b><br /><br /><b>Note:</b> If you are executing samples in a named instance as is the default for SQL Server Express you may need to modify some of the scripts in order to run the sample correctly.  Some samples assume they are being executed in the default instance.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> To run the SMOPing sample, make sure you pass in the server name and instance with no space, for example: <br /><br /><b><span class="codeInline">SMOPing.exe -S</span></b> <i><span class="codeInline">servername</span></i><b><span class="codeInline">\</span></b><i><span class="codeInline">instancename</span></i><br /><br />Vista is supported for most samples except as otherwise noted.  You will have have to install these MSIs running as a privileged administrator on Vista.<br /><br />Note that although a sample ReadMe file may indicate that the sample works correctly in both SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008, you must download and use the correct installer for the version of SQL Server you are using.  A sample from the SQL Server 2005 distribution may not work correctly on SQL Server 2008 and visa versa.<br /><br />The SQL Server 2008 February 2008 CTP contains samples which will support the SQL Server 2008 February 2008 CTP release of SQL Server.<br /><br />New samples for the SQL Server 2008 February 2008 CTP include<br />Data Access (ODBC):

<h4> <a name="_Common_Language_Runtime_(CLR)_Integ"></a>  Common Language Runtime(CLR) Integration</h4>
<table><tr><td> <b>Sample name</b></td><td> <b>Description</b> </td></tr>
<tr><td>  AdventureWorks CLR Layer </td><td>  The AdventureWorks CLR Integration Layer sample for Microsoft SQL Server provides some useful utilities that form an extra layer of functionality on top of the base <b>AdventureWorks</b> sample database.The first utility creates contact records for various types of people involved in the <b>AdventureWorks</b> database. The contact information is specified by using XML and is passed to a C#-based stored procedure. The second utility defines a <b>Currency</b> user-defined data type by using C#. This user-defined data type encapsulates both an amount and a culture which helps determine the correct way to render the amount as a currency value in that culture. The third utility provides a currency conversion function that returns an instance of the <b>Currency</b> user-defined type. If the <b>AdventureWorks</b> database has a conversion rate from USD to the correct currency associated with the specified culture, the conversion function returns a <b>Currency</b> user-defined type that has the converted rate and a culture that matches the requested culture. Otherwise, a <b>Currency</b> user-defined type is returned with the original amount (which should be in USD) with the en-us culture.The utilities also demonstrate how to unregister and register common language runtime (CLR) methods and assemblies by using Transact-SQL.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  ArrayParameter </td><td>  Demonstrates how to pass an array of information from a client to a CLR integration stored procedure on the server using a CLR integration user-defined data type.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  AssemblyCleanup </td><td>  The AssemblyCleanup sample contains a .NET Stored Procedure, written in C#, that cleans-up unused assemblies in the current database by querying the metadata catalogs.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  Calendar-Aware Date/Time UDTs </td><td>  The CADatetime sample defines two user-defined data types (CADatetime and CADate) which provide calendar-aware handling of dates and times.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  <a name="CurrencyWebService"></a> CurrencyWebService </td><td>  The Currency Web Service sample for SQL Server demonstrates how to invoke a Web service from server-side common language runtime code. Suppose that there is a Web server available somewhere which can supply current currency exchange information. This sample demonstrates how to expose the result of calling that Web service as a common language runtime-based table valued function (TVF). This table valued function could be used, for example, to periodically insert new rows into the Sales.CurrencyRate rate table in the AdventureWorks database. A simple implementation of the Web service is provided to demonstrate the complete scenario, but the data used in the sample is fictitious. <b>This sample is not supported in SQL Server Express.</b> </td></tr>
<tr><td>  Hello World </td><td>  The Hello World sample demonstrates the basic operations that are involved in creating, deploying, and testing a simple CLR integration-based stored procedure. This sample also demonstrates how to return data via an output parameter and via a record, which is dynamically constructed by the stored procedure and returned to the client.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  Hello World Ready Sample </td><td> The Hello World Ready sample demonstrates the basic operations that are involved in creating, deploying, and testing a simple world ready CLR integration-based stored procedure. A world ready component can be easily localized into different languages for different markets around the world without changing the component&#39;s source code. This sample also demonstrates how to return data through an output parameter and through a record, which is dynamically constructed by the stored procedure and returned to the client. </td></tr>
<tr><td>  Handling LOB using CLR </td><td>  Demonstrates using CLR stored procedures to transfer large binary objects between a SQL Server database and files accessible to the server. It also demonstrates registering and dropping CLR stored procedures and assemblies, invoking CLR stored procedures, performing data access from CLR stored procedures, invoking Transact-SQL stored procedures from CLR stored procedures, and using a file to log errors during processing of server-side code.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  Impersonation Sample </td><td>  The Impersonation sample demonstrates how to use impersonation to use the credentials passed from the client to access operating system protected resources, such as files, when you are using integrated security.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  In-Process Data Access Sample </td><td>  This sample contains several simple functions that demonstrate various features of the CLR Integration in-process data access provider.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  <a name="OracleTVF"></a> Oracle TVF  (December 2005) </td><td>  Demonstrates how to invoke the managed code interface to Oracle to expose the results of any Oracle query as a table-valued function.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  Result Set Sample </td><td>  This sample demonstrates how to use server-side cursors to get around absence of Multiple Active Result Set (MARS) support for server side programming.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  <a name="SendDataSet"></a> Send DataSet  (December 2005) </td><td>  Demonstrates how to return an ADO.NET based DataSet within a server side CLR-based stored procedure as a result set to the client.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  Spatial </td><td>  This sample demonstrates how to use SQL Server&#39;s CLR based Table Valued Functions to implement spatial indexing which enables complex high performance spatial queries. This same technique may be used to index many other kinds of data which is not natively indexed by SQL Server for many different types of applications.  </td></tr>
<tr><td>  String Manipulate </td><td>  This sample shows the implementation of five Transact-SQL string functions that provide the same string-manipulate functions as built-in functions, but with the additional surrogate-aware capability to handle both Unicode and surrogate strings. The five functions are: <b>len<i>s()</b>, <b>left</i>s()</b>, <b>right<i>s()</b>, <b>sub</i>s()</b>, and <b>replace_s()</b>.  Using these functions is the same as using LEN(), LEFT(), RIGHT(), SUBSTRING(), and REPLACE() in string type functions.  </td></tr>

The execution results of the script, query, or statement can be stored in a file together with relevant SQL Server Profiler trace information. New in the July 2006 release of ascmd is two new features. The first is the ability to execute custom XMLA requests. Using this feature you will be able to execute XMLA Discovers and XMLA Executes. For example, you are able to determine what databases are on an SSAS instance. You are be able to execute statements that change the default properties so the only the data is returned; not the schema  and the data. Second, ascmd now detects if the XMLA input stream is a valid XMLA Command or not. If it is not a valid XMLA Command then it assumes that it is an XMLA Statement and it automatically html encode the input and wraps a &lt;Statement&gt;...&lt;/Statement&gt; element around it. This allows you to enter simpler input files when entering MDX queries and DMX statements. See the ascmd readme for more information.  </td></tr>
