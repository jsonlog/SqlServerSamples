<div class="wikidoc"><h4>Can the community contribute code in all of these projects?</h4>The answer varies for the different categories of projects. For &quot;Product Samples&quot;, anyone in the community can log bugs and make suggestions, but the code in these projects is produced by Microsoft. For &quot;Community Samples&quot;, individuals can submit applications to be posted. Whether to accept contributions is up to the contributor of each application. For the Independent projects, anyone can apply to get involved as a contributor.<br />
<h4>Can I download just the engine samples or do I need to download samples for every technology area?</h4>You can absolutely download just the engine samples.  Go to the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MSFTEngProdSamples">Engine product samples project</a> and you&#39;ll find a separate installer in the <b>Releases</b> tab with just the Engine samples in it.  The same is true for all product samples.  You don&#39;t even need to download samples if you just want to browse the source code.  Check out the <b>Source Code</b> tab in each product sample project.<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
