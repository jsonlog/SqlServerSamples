    "Description": "Hi, I am working on a Report Services project and I just need to be able to check if a directory (based on user and it’s LDAP group) exist or not.  I have used T-SQL, used VB.NET code inside report properties and also used C# class library and none worked.\n \nAll will return 0 or false.  I will be happy to provide code for each one of these if needed.  \n \nAny help greatly appreciated\n \nThank you",
