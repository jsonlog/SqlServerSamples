    "Description": "The database schema for the AdventureWorks2008 (SQL Server 2008) is noticeably different from the schema for AdventureWorks (SQL Server 2005).  There are 9 new tables in AdventureWorks2008 (BusinessEntity, BusinessEntityAddress, BusinessEntityContact, EmailAddress, Password, Person, PersonPhone, PhoneNumberType, and PersonCreditCard), and 6 tables have been eliminated (EmployeeAddress, VendorAddress, VendorContact, CustomerAddress, Individual, and StoreContact).\n \nWhile a data dictionary exists for AdventureWorks, Microsoft has indicated that there are currently no plans to update it for AdventureWorks2008.\n \nGiven the significance of the changes between AdventureWorks and AdventureWorks2008, I would greatly appreciate having Microsoft update the data dictionary for AdventureWorks2008 (especially for us database novices).  Thank you.",
