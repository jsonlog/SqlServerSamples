    "Description": "I downloaded the BSP for Beagleboard. Opening the .sln file in MS Visual studio, I tried to build the solution which yields NK.bin file in \"Rel\" directory. I copied this file to SD card to make the beagleboard to boot in WINCE. This is not successful. What else files required to boot ?  If needed from where I can find those files? Is there any setting required to be done in Visual Studio.",
