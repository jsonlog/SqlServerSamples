    "Description": "Hi, \n\n I need your advice, how to troubleshoot this issue.\n\nI try to create link server to DB2 (now call Universe or U2).\n\nWhen I created link server using ODBC connection on SQL server 2016, It hang. I have to kill SSMS 2016.\n\nI also try \"test connection\" feature and it's also hang.\n\nNote:\n\n1). I do not have problem with the ODBC setup on SQL 2012. The connection is working fine on the same machine. \n\n2). I am using DB2 ODBC driver\n\nPlease let help! How can I find what is the problem? Is there any setting to find this problem\n\nI look at [SQL server](https://mindmajix.com/sql-server-training) error log and could not find any error.\n\nThanks\nNatasha Mary",
