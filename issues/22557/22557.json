    "Description": "When installing Toad 6.8 I checked the box that integrated Toad into [SQL Server](https://mindmajix.com/ssis-training) Management Studio. When I launched management studio it gave me an error (something about unable to load the add-in). Now, whenever I right-click on any node in management studio I get this pop-up:\n\nXamlObjectWriterException\nCannot set unknown Member\n'{clr-namespace;Quest.Toad.SSMSAddin.Menus;assembly=Dell.ToadSSMSAddinCore, Version 7.0.10.0, Culture=Neutral, PublicKeyToken=....}ToadCommandMenuItem.CommandId\n\nAt this point I just want SQL Server management studio back to how it was so I can right-click on nodes.\n\nI've completely uninstalled Toad 6.8 but the issue remains.\n\nPlease help\nNatasha Mary",
