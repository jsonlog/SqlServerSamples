This error is returned when an attempt is made to create a connection____ manager for an unknown connection type. Check the spelling in the connection type name.\"\n__\n\nThe SSIS package runs fine through SQL Server Agent and Visual Studio 2015.  I've downloaded the __Azure Feature Pack for Integration Services \n____\n\nIs there another patch for SSMS? that I don't know of?\n\nThank you",
