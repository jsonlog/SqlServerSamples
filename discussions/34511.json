I would like to incorporate the &quot;Person&quot; and &quot;HumanResources&quot; schemas (and the handling of entitie's PK using the BusinessEntity table ID) of the 2008 schema into a SQL Server 2005 Schema. 1.) Does anyone see a problem with using the 08 approach in 05 -Note: am not planning to use LINQ at this time, and 2.) I am a little confused about how to generate an auto generated BusinessEntityID in the BusinessEntity table (unless I add an insertable field - i.e., other than autogenerated or newid( ) or getdate( )) - therefore, is it necessary to add a field to this table in order to get an 'insert' action on this table or can one create an INSERT statement without any values - in order to get the 'auto generated' pk to populate?</span>\r\n",
