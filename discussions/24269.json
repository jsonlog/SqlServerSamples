I can't find anyone. (yes, I'm using VS 2008, but SQL Server 2005.)<br /><br />After playing around a bit (essentially inside SQL) I managed to run a C++ compiled function in SQL. I am having the assembly compiled with /clr:safe and a strong name.<br />But when I create the assembly inside SQL I always need to set UNSAFE security context, otherwise it wont work (according to the error message above.) Also, I have to import the assembly's private key into MSSQL, and then set up a new login and user that have access to this key. Luckely, there is a posting about this on <a href=\"http://forums.microsoft.com:%20http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1673459&amp;SiteID=1\" class=\"externalLink\">http://forums.microsoft.com: http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1673459&amp;SiteID=1<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a><br /><br />I thought the /clr:safe compile option was only required for security context safe mode. Is unrestricted mode for mixed /clr, but not working yet? (C.p. <a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hc912f03(VS.80).aspx\" class=\"externalLink\">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hc912f03(VS.80).aspx<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a>)<br /><br />Anyway, is this the reason there are no C++ sample code? :-)<br />",
